I love solving algorithmic challenges, understanding how things work under the hood, and building projects from scratch. Iâ€™m currently learning C, C++, and Python, and I spend a lot of time improving my skills in data structures and Competitive Programming.

I'm working on a simple compiler project and exploring how programming languages and interpreters work. I also dream of contributing to open-source tools that help students learn, and maybe even teaching or researching someday.
